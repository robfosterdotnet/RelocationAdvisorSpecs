**Data Quality:** Great Expectations, dbt tests, custom validation frameworks

**Government Data:** Census API, BLS API, NOAA data, FRED, BEA

---

## Professional Style

Rachel is **detail-oriented and methodical**. She thinks deeply about data quality and edge cases. Her database designs are elegant and well-documented.

**Strengths:**
- **Data modeling**: Designs schemas that scale and make sense
- **API expertise**: Knows government data APIs inside out
- **Quality obsession**: Catches data issues others miss
- **Documentation**: Her data dictionaries are works of art

**Communication style:** Thorough and precise. Uses diagrams and examples. Happy to explain concepts multiple times in different ways.

---

## What She Cares About

1. **Data quality**: Is the data accurate, complete, and consistent?
2. **Schema design**: Will this structure serve future needs?
3. **Documentation**: Can someone else understand this data?
4. **Reproducibility**: Can we re-run this pipeline reliably?

---

## How You'll Interact

- **Sprint 1**: Database schema design and review
- **Sprints 2-3**: ETL pipeline guidance and data quality checks
- **Throughout**: Questions about data sources and transformations

**Pro tip**: Rachel loves when you ask about data quality edge cases. "What happens if this field is null?" is her favorite question.

---

## Government Data Expertise

Rachel has worked extensively with federal data sources:

**Census Bureau:**
- American Community Survey (ACS)
- Decennial Census
- Variable naming conventions
- Geographic hierarchies (FIPS codes, GEOIDs)

**Bureau of Labor Statistics:**
- Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)
- Occupational Employment Statistics (OES)
- Series ID formats

**NOAA:**
- Climate Normals
- Station data
- Weather station to county mapping challenges

---

## Data Quality Philosophy

Rachel's approach to data quality:

1. **Trust but verify**: Always spot-check against authoritative sources
2. **Handle nulls explicitly**: Never assume data will be complete
3. **Document anomalies**: When you find weird data, write it down
4. **Validate at boundaries**: Check data when it enters your system
5. **Make it reproducible**: Anyone should be able to re-run your pipeline

---

## Pet Peeves

- Assuming data is clean without checking
- Ignoring null values or special codes
- Not documenting data transformations
- Hardcoding values that could change
- Designing schemas without thinking about queries

---

## Fun Facts

- Speaks three languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese)
- Runs a popular data engineering blog
- Amateur astronomer (owns a 10" telescope)
- Competitive Scrabble player
- Makes incredible tamales (family recipe)

## Quotes

> "Bad data in, bad decisions out. Quality matters at every step."

> "If you can't explain where a number came from, you shouldn't trust it."

> "The Census API is quirky, but once you understand it, it's incredibly powerful."

> "Always check the data dictionary. The variable name lies, the documentation doesn't."

## Working With Rachel

**Do:**
- Ask about data quality edge cases
- Verify your data against the source
- Document any transformations you apply
- Ask why she made specific schema decisions
- Share interesting data anomalies you find

**Don't:**
- Assume government data is always correct
- Ignore null values or skip records silently
- Change the schema without discussing it
- Forget to handle special Census codes (-666666666, etc.)
- Load data without validating it first

*"Data engineering is detective work. You're always asking 'where did this come from?' and 'can I trust it?' Embrace the curiosity."*
