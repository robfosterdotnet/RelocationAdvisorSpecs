---

## Professional Style

Sarah is a **patient teacher** who believes in learning by doing. She won't give you the answer directly, but she'll guide you to find it yourself. Her code reviews are thorough but constructive.

**Strengths:**
- **Technical depth**: Can debug anything, knows systems inside out
- **Teaching**: Explains complex concepts clearly
- **Code quality**: High standards but reasonable expectations
- **Problem-solving**: Breaks down big problems into small pieces

**Communication style:** Direct and technical, but kind. Uses code examples and diagrams. Prefers async communication but available for calls when needed.

---

## What She Cares About

1. **Code quality**: Is it readable, maintainable, tested?
2. **Learning**: Are you understanding the concepts, not just copying?
3. **Best practices**: Following patterns that scale
4. **Security**: No vulnerabilities, proper handling of secrets

---

## How You'll Interact

- **Technical guidance**: Her documents guide each sprint
- **Code reviews**: She reviews all your PRs
- **Architecture questions**: Reach out when design decisions arise
- **Debugging help**: After you've tried for 30+ minutes

**Pro tip**: When asking Sarah for help, show what you've already tried. She responds better to "I tried X and Y, but got error Z" than "It doesn't work."

---

## Code Review Style

Sarah's code reviews are **learning opportunities**. Expect comments like:

- "This works, but consider using X pattern for better maintainability"
- "Good solution! One edge case to think about..."
- "Nice! I learned something from this approach"
- "Let's discuss this in a call - there's a tradeoff here worth exploring"

**She will NOT:**
- Rewrite your code for you
- Approve code that doesn't meet standards
- Be harsh or dismissive

---

## Pet Peeves

- Code without tests
- Catching exceptions and silently ignoring them
- Hardcoded secrets or configuration
- Copy-pasting code without understanding it
- Not reading error messages before asking for help

---

## Fun Facts

- Competitive rock climber (V7 boulderer)
- Maintains two popular open-source Python libraries
- Mechanical keyboard enthusiast (built 3 custom boards)
- Makes her own hot sauce
- Has a cat named "Null"

## Quotes

> "The best code is code you don't have to write. The second best is code someone else can understand."

> "If you're not sure, write a test. The test will tell you."

> "Reading documentation is a superpower. Most developers skip it."

> "I'd rather review 5 small PRs than 1 giant PR."

## Working With Sarah

**Do:**
- Read the error message carefully before asking for help
- Break your work into small, reviewable chunks
- Write tests for your code
- Ask "why" questions - she loves explaining concepts
- Document your code decisions

**Don't:**
- Copy-paste code you don't understand
- Submit PRs without testing locally
- Ask questions you could Google in 30 seconds
- Take code review feedback personally
- Be afraid to push back if you disagree (with reasoning)

*"My job is to help you become a better developer, not to do the work for you. Ask questions, make mistakes, and learn from them. That's how we all got here."*
