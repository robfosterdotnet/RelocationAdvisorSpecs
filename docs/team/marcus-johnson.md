1. **User value**: Does this solve a real problem for users?

- **Requirements questions**: Slack him anytime for clarification
- **Demo reviews**: He'll review your work at end of each sprint
- **Blockers**: First escalation point when you're stuck

**Pro tip**: Marcus appreciates when you flag risks early. He'd rather know about a potential problem on Monday than be surprised on Friday.
