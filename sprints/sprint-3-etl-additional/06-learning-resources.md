## Data Integration Concepts
- Working with multiple data sources
- Geographic data mapping
- Handling data at different granularities
- Caching API responses

## Key Concepts
1. **Batch Processing** - Group API calls to reduce requests
2. **Geographic Crosswalks** - Mapping between different area codes
3. **Data Coverage** - Not all sources have data for all areas
4. **Caching** - Don't re-fetch data you already have
