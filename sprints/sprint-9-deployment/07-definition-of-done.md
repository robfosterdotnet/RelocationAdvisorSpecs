## Final Project Review

### You Should Be Able To...

**Explain the Architecture:**
- "The application has three tiers: React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database"
- "Data flows from federal APIs through ETL pipelines into our normalized schema"

**Discuss Technical Decisions:**
- "We chose PostgreSQL for its reliability and geographic data support"
