# Sprint 0: Onboarding & Environment Setup

**Duration:** 3-4 days
**Sprint Goal:** Get your development environment fully configured and understand the project context

---

## Welcome to DataVista Solutions!

Welcome to your first day! This sprint is about getting set up and understanding what we're building. In a real company, you'd spend your first few days:

- Setting up your laptop and development tools
- Getting access to repositories and systems
- Reading documentation about the project
- Meeting your team and understanding the codebase

Let's simulate that experience.
