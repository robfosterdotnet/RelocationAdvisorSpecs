# Sprint 4: Data Analysis & Visualization

**Duration:** 4-5 days
**Sprint Goal:** Analyze and visualize the loaded data using Power BI Desktop to understand patterns, quality, and insights

---

## Sprint Overview

You've built the data layer - now it's time to explore and understand what you have. This sprint teaches you:

- Business Intelligence (BI) fundamentals
- Power BI Desktop for data visualization
- Connecting BI tools to PostgreSQL
- Creating interactive dashboards and reports
- Data quality assessment and profiling
- Discovering insights that will inform your API design

---

## Why This Sprint Matters

Before building an API to serve data, you need to **understand your data**:

1. **Data Quality** - Are there gaps, outliers, or inconsistencies?
2. **Distributions** - What do the numbers look like across the country?
3. **Correlations** - How do metrics relate to each other?
4. **User Value** - What insights are most valuable to users?

This analysis will directly inform your API design and scoring engine in upcoming sprints.

## Tools You'll Use

### Power BI Desktop
- **What:** Microsoft's free desktop BI tool
- **Download:** https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/
- **Why:** Industry-standard tool, great for your resume

### PostgreSQL Connection
- Power BI connects directly to your local PostgreSQL database
- No API needed - direct database queries
