Perfect — below is a complete, self-contained “project packet” written entirely in Markdown that you can hand directly to your son.



Think of this as something between:



a real-world take-home assignment, and
a guided capstone project he can iterate on and showcase.




You can copy/paste this into a repo as README.md (and optionally break sections into multiple .md files later).









📦 Relocation Advisor App – Project Packet







Project Name





Relocation Advisor

“Find the best place to live based on what matters to you.”









1. Project Overview







Objective





Build a full-stack data-driven application that helps users evaluate and compare U.S. locations (state, county, or metro) based on:



Cost of living
Income & job market
Climate preferences
Quality-of-life indicators




The app must:



Use multiple publicly available datasets
Normalize and model the data
Expose a custom REST API
Provide a modern interactive UI
Be extensible and production-minded




This project simulates the type of system design and implementation expected of an entry-level to mid-level data-aware software engineer or systems analyst.

4. Data Sources (Required)





You must use at least 3 different public data sources.





Required Core Sources







1. U.S. Census – American Community Survey (ACS)



Used for:



Median household income
Median home value
Rent
Population
Education levels




Formats:



CSV
API






2. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)



Used for:



Unemployment rate
Median wages
Job growth trends




Formats:



API
CSV






3. Climate / Weather Data (Choose One)





NOAA historical climate data
NASA Earth climate datasets




Used for:



Average temperature
Seasonal variance
Precipitation










5. Optional / Bonus Data Sources





Data.gov
Crime rates
Food access
Public health indicators

FiveThirtyEight
Cultural or lifestyle trivia
“Fun facts” per region

OpenStreetMap
Location boundaries
Mapping features











6. Data Ingestion Requirements







ETL Pipeline





Create a /etl directory containing scripts that:



Download or fetch raw data
Clean and normalize fields
Map geographic identifiers (FIPS codes)
Load into the database






Must Handle:





Missing values
Unit conversions
Inconsistent naming
Different update cadences






Example ETL Script Responsibilities





fetch_census_data.py
fetch_bls_data.py
fetch_climate_data.py
normalize_locations.py
load_database.py

8. Derived Metrics (Critical)





Create computed scores based on normalized values.





Example Scores





Affordability Score
Job Market Score
Climate Comfort Score
Education Score
Overall Quality-of-Life Score




Scores should be scaled (e.g., 0–100) and documented.









9. API Requirements







Base Requirements





RESTful design
JSON responses
Pagination
Filtering
Sorting
Input validation
Error handling






Example Endpoints



GET /locations

GET /locations/{id}

GET /rankings

GET /compare

POST /preferences



Example Query Parameters



/rankings?

  income_weight=0.3&

  climate_weight=0.2&

  cost_weight=0.3&

  jobs_weight=0.2









10. Frontend Requirements







Core Pages





Home / Landing
Explore Map
Rankings Dashboard
Location Detail Page
Comparison View






Required UI Features





Interactive map
Preference sliders
Sortable tables
Charts (bar, radar, line)
Responsive design






Suggested Libraries





React / Vue
Chart.js / Recharts
Leaflet / Mapbox










11. Gamification (Fun but Valuable)





Add one of the following:



Badges for exploring regions
“Did you know?” trivia per location
Shareable rankings
Personal relocation profile










12. Non-Functional Requirements





Clean repo structure
Meaningful commit history
Clear README
Environment config via .env
Basic performance optimization
Clear separation of concerns










13. Stretch Goals (Optional)





Authentication & saved preferences
Caching (Redis)
Scheduled data refresh
Dockerized deployment
CI/CD pipeline
Public demo deployment

16. How to Present This in Interviews





“I built a relocation decision platform that integrates multiple federal datasets, normalizes them into a unified data model, exposes a custom scoring API, and renders an interactive UI that lets users dynamically rank locations based on personal priorities.”



That sentence alone is resume gold.









17. Final Note to the Builder





This project is not about perfection.



It’s about:



making decisions,
documenting tradeoffs,
and shipping something real.




Build it in phases. Refactor later. Learn constantly.
